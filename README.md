2. Click the "Save Changes" button on the specific package card
3. You'll see a confirmation message that your changes were saved

## Notes and Best Practices

- Make all desired changes before publishing to minimize updates to the live site
- If the Silver package is set as "Featured," the Gold package will no longer be marked as featured and vice versa
- Price inputs should be numbers only (no $ sign needed)
- For the Custom Package, use empty lines (double line breaks) to create separate paragraphs in the description
- Custom package uses a text field for price display, so you can enter "Custom Quote" or any other text
- Font Awesome icon classes should follow the format "fas fa-[icon-name]" - you can browse available icons at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

## Responsive Design

The admin dashboard is fully responsive and provides an optimal experience across different devices:

- **Desktop View**: Full sidebar navigation and multi-column layout for packages and add-ons
- **Tablet View**: Collapsible sidebar navigation and adjusted grid layout for better touch interaction
- **Mobile View**: Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu and single-column layout for forms
- **All Devices**: Touch-friendly buttons and inputs with appropriate sizing for finger interaction

## Technical Information

The system uses localStorage to store package and add-on data. Changes are saved immediately when clicking "Save Changes", but aren't reflected on the public site until you click "Publish Changes to Website".

## Technical Implementation Details

### Mobile Menu Toggle Fix
The mobile menu toggle was made more accessible by:
1. Increasing the z-index to ensure it appears above other elements
2. Setting pointer-events: none on the .bar elements to ensure clicks pass through to the button
3. Increasing the padding and touch target size to 50px height and width
4. Adding visual feedback for hover and active states
5. Properly handling click events in the responsive-helper.js file

### Welcome Message Enhancement
The welcome message was improved by:
1. Creating a dynamic system that shows different content based on screen size
2. Adding a stylish gradient background on desktop views
3. Displaying current dashboard statistics (packages, add-ons, events)
4. Adding quick action buttons for frequent tasks
5. Implementing responsive styling that looks good on all devices

These improvements enhance the overall user experience of the admin dashboard while making it more accessible and functional on mobile devices.
